# Spark-E1
Spark E1 is the Pakistan's first 3d printer control board. It is a 32 bit board that runs on the dual core, RISC-V based eSP32 microcontroller. It is cheaper than the Arduino mega + RAMPS setup that most people use. Plus the RAMPS setup is 8 bit while this board is 32 bit. I hope we will help the community with this board and make even better boards in the future InshaAllah!
